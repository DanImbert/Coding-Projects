If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Characterizing the audio aura based on the top 100 songs of a listener would provide an average representation of the energy,
valence, and danceability present in their most frequently played music during that year. However, this approach might oversimplify the listener's
emotional range and preferences since it doesn't consider variations in mood, genre diversity, or personal context across different periods or life events.

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Faults: It overlooks mood changes over time.
It may focus on specific genres, missing diversity in taste.
Basic metrics like energy and valence oversimplify emotional experiences.

Better methods could involve:

Examining data over multiple years for evolving patterns.
Using diverse emotional indicators like lyrics or user feedback.
Incorporating specific user habits for a more tailored representation.
